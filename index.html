<p>This project is funded by the Mind Hand Heart Innovation Grant.  The goal of my project is to place public artificial lightboxes around locations on campus for people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).  Lightboxes  are large and expensive, making it challenging for students to have consistent access to them.  By placing lightboxes in accessible locations on campus, we can ameliorate some of the effects from the north eastern winter. </p>

<a id="lightbox-models" class="anchor" href="#lightbox-models" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lightbox Models</h2>

<p>We have two types of lightboxes on campus: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NatureBright-SunTouch-Light-Therapy-package/dp/B000W8Y7FY?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0">desk lamp</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Northern-Light-Technology-Flamingo-Therapy/dp/B003XDIPNA/ref=sr_1_7_s_it?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468243953&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=light+therapy+lamp">floor lamp</a>.  </p>

<p>Both lamps provide 10,000 lux of UV blocked light. The desk lamp provides 'blue light and ions'. The floor lamp features 'full spectrum light'.  Try out both to determine which model works best for you.</p>

</h2>

<p>Light therapy is a way to treat seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and certain other conditions by exposure to artificial light. SAD is a type of depression that occurs at a certain time each year, usually in the fall or winter.</p>

<p>During light therapy, you sit or work near a device called a light therapy box. The box gives off bright light that mimics natural outdoor light.</p>

<p>Light therapy is thought to affect brain chemicals linked to mood and sleep, easing SAD symptoms. Using a light therapy box may also help with other types of depression, sleep disorders and other conditions. Light therapy is also known as bright light therapy or phototherapy</p>

<p>Light therapy is generally safe. If side effects occur, they're usually mild and short lasting. They may include:
*Eyestrain
*Headache
*Nausea
*Irritability
*agitation
*Mania, euphoria, hyperactivity or agitation associated with bipolar disorder</p>

<p>When side effects do occur, they may go away on their own within a few days of starting light therapy. You also may be able to manage side effects by reducing treatment time, moving farther from your light box, taking breaks during long sessions or changing the time of day you use light therapy. Talk to your doctor for advice if side effects are a problem.</p>

<a id="when-to-use-caution" class="anchor" href="#when-to-use-caution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When to use caution</h4>

<p>It's best to be under the care of a health professional while using light box therapy. It's always a good idea to talk to a doctor before starting light therapy, but it's especially important if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a condition that makes your skin especially sensitive to light, such as systemic lupus erythematosus</li>
<li>You take medications that increase your sensitivity to sunlight, such as certain antibiotics, anti-inflammatories or the herbal supplement St. John's Wort</li>
<li>You have an eye condition that makes your eyes vulnerable to light damage</li>
</ul>

<p>Light therapy may trigger mania in some people with bipolar disorder, so get advice from your doctor before starting light therapy. If you have any concerns about how light therapy may be affecting your mood or thoughts, seek help right away.</p>

<p>We have a short supply of light boxes to set up on other places in campus.  Please email me if you would like to receive one (<a href="mailto:aanders@mit.edu">aanders@mit.edu</a>) </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile.
