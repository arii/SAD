The goal of my project is to place public artificial lightbox locations on campus for people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).\r\n\r\n## Where to find lightboxes\r\nCurrently, lightboxes are set up in the telephone booths of the MIT Stata Center.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Innovation Fund\r\nThe [MindHandHeart Innovation Fund](http://mindhandheart.mit.edu/innovation-fund) seeks to leverage the enthusiasm and problem-solving skills of the MIT community to find new and inventive ways of increasing awareness about mental health, building communities of support, and promoting life and wellness skills.  \r\n\r\n## Seasonal Affective Disorder\r\nThe following is a summary from the [SAD wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder). \r\n> Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), also known as winter depression, winter blues, summer depression, summertime sadness, or seasonal depression, is a mood disorder subset in which people who have normal mental health throughout most of the year experience depressive symptoms at the same time each year, most commonly in the winter.\r\n> Treatments for classic (winter-based) seasonal affective disorder include light therapy, medication, ionized-air administration, cognitive-behavioral therapy and carefully timed supplementation of the hormone melatonin.  \r\n\r\n## Requests for lightboxes on campus\r\nWe have a short supply of light boxes to set up on other places in campus.  Please email me if you would like to receive one (aanders@mit.edu) \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n* If you have any questions or comments about this project, feel free to contact me at aanders@mit.edu\r\n\r\n",
